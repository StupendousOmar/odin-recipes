    <p>Thin crust pizza, such as New York style pizza dough, is much thinner, and usually the same width from the crust to the very edge of the pizza slices</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yeast</strong>: This thin crust pizza dough starts with one teaspoon of active dry yeast.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> and <strong>water</strong>: Activate the yeast in white sugar and lukewarm water.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This crispy thin crust calls for all-purpose flour instead of bread flour</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Salt tightens the gluten structure, which strengthens the dough and makes it more elastic. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
